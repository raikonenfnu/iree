# Updates the checked-in ELF files used for testing the ELF loader.
# In general we try not to check in binary files however these files act as a
# test of binary compatibility for artifacts users may have produced. If a
# build break occurs here we know that we have broken compatibility. Today this
# happens every few months as we are not yet binary-stable but in the future
# will be a bigger issue.
#
# To use, ensure iree-translate, compiled ld.lld, and 7z are on your PATH and
# run the script:
#   $ ./iree/hal/local/elf/testdata/generate.sh

# Uncomment to see the iree-translate commands issued:
# set -x
set -e
